# Gravey

Gravey is a community-driven Discord bot developed and maintained by the CPA @ SLC graduating class of 2026. 
The bot, themed after one of our professors, is as a fun side project for our class and aims to provide our peers with helpful utilities, programming resources, and course-related updates.
Hopefully we can help everyone learn more about programming and aid each other in this course together.

This bot is fully open-source and we allow modification. Contributions from the community are welcomed, and feel free to suggest improvements to the code or add your own features, with a pull request.
